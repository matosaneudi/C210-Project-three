# C210-Project-three
grocery store program 
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project solved the problem of not having the data of produce sold organized to see what and how much was sold that day.
  This program gets the the produce sold data from a .txt file and organizes it into a .dat file that stores the "item" and "frequency". 
  
What did you do particularly well?
  What i did particularly well is how i broke down the program into seperate functions and minimized redundant code, this was achieved by the use of maps.
  This kept the code clean and the program small and manageable while still being able to perfrom all the required functions.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  Its hard for me to visualize where I can improve the code at the moment because it took all of my skills i have gathered to this point and without the 
  feedback from my instructor its difficult to see where this project can be improved but i am sure there is plenty of ways.
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most challenging part for me was implementing maps and figuring out a way to prevent the user input to be saved into the map. To implement maps 
  i used zybooks section 11.4 youTube and stackoverflow, this helped me understand and how to use it.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I know i am talking about maps a lot but this is the back bone to how i approached this project and honeslty after the map implementation all the other code was 
  text book stuff like the switch case and defiining a function. With that beig said I believe maps is what i will be tranfering to other projects if its the right solution 
  this will help me organized data. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made this programs this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by having the menu.cpp where the menu funcions live and making that sparate from the main function. 
  Also, i used a seperate function with maps that runs when the program is compiled that automatically reads the .txt file and finds the frequencies.
